Got it — you want a **short, crisp, meaningful** step-by-step list, like a **summary for quick understanding**.

Here’s the **concise version** you asked for:

---

# 📋 Program Summary

**Step 1:** Google Maps place URL input → `initialize_browser(url)`  
→ Opens the URL in Chrome.

**Step 2:** Click "All reviews" button → `get_all_reviews_button()`  
→ Opens full reviews section.

**Step 3:** Extract all reviews → `extract_reviews()`  
→ Collects all visible review texts.

**Step 4:** Summarize the extracted reviews → `summarize_reviews(reviews)`  
→ AI generates a short summary.

**Step 5:** Generate an auto-comment → `generate_comment(summary)`  
→ AI creates a comment based on summary.

**Step 6:** Wait for user ENTER key → `input()`  
→ Pause for manual check (e.g., signed-in status).

**Step 7:** Click "Write a review" button → `post_comment(comment)`  
→ Types and submits the auto-comment.  
⚠️ **Problem:** Needs Google account signed in — else fails.

**Step 8:** Save session data to CSV → `save_to_csv()`  
→ Stores URL, summary, and comment in a file.

**Step 9:** Show session summary → `prepare_and_print_logs()`  
→ Displays all reviews processed so far.

**Step 10:** Loop for next URL or Exit → `main()`  
→ Continue or finish the session.

# ⚠️ Important Note:
> **Posting reviews requires Google Sign-In**, which Selenium cannot handle unless you open Chrome with your **real user profile**.
